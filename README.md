Action plan :


 Break down the front-end into components and break-down using Excalidraw.
 Use UI libraries such as Material UI, react slick, or any other 
 Make sure that the Carousel as well as the Accordion are functional.
 Try to build  front-end as close to the given Figma design as possible.
